Adafruit CircuitPython driver for SSD1306 OLED displays.

This driver is based on the SSD1306 driver in the MicroPython source but differs
by supporting hardware I2C interfaces and Adafruit CircuitPython API.  For a
MicroPython machine API compatible library see: https://github.com/adafruit/micropython-adafruit-ssd1306
